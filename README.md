# GameShop


## Project Description

This application is a simple online video game shop. Users can view the site and browse games without need to login. Games are displayed with their box art on the main view. To make a purchase, an account is needed. A user can create an account if they do not have one or log in to an existing account. Once logged in, a user can add items to their cart. Items can also be removed if no longer wanted by the user. Apart from making purchases, a User will also be able to edit their basic information. When a user checks out, an order is created containing their items. The item stock is updated when an item is added to an order. A user can view their current orders as well as their order history.
